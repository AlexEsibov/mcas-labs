### Estimated time to complete
30 min

Continuous reports in Cloud Discovery analyze all logs that are
forwarded from your network using Cloud App Security. They provide
improved visibility over all data, and automatically identify anomalous
use using either the Machine Learning anomaly detection engine or by
using custom policies that you define.
To use this capability, you will perform in this lab the configuration
and troubleshooting of the Cloud Discovery feature.

> NOTE: The Docker engine has been pre-installed on LinuxVM using the commands at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker-ubuntu](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/discovery-docker-ubuntu)

## How to troubleshoot the Docker log collector
[ðŸ”™](#microsoft-365-cloud-app-security)

In this task, you will review possible troubleshooting steps to identify
issues in automatic logs upload from the log collector.

There are several things to test at different locations: in the log
collector, in MCAS, at the network level.

### Useful commands
	
- To navigate in the directories, use the "cd" command.
	Examples: 

	**cd /var/adallom** to go to the specified directory

	**cd /** to go to the root directory

	**cd ..** to go to the parent directory
	
- To display the content of the logs, use the **more file_name** command
- To display the content of the directory, use the **ll** command
- To clear the screen, use the **clear** command

- For saving typing, use the **Tab** key and perform autocompletion.

### Verify the log collector (container) status

1. On Client01, open a session on PuTTY to **192.168.141.125** and use the credentials below.

	**user01**

	**Passw0rd1**

1. Run the following commands:

	```
	sudo -i
	```
	```
	docker stats
	```
	This command will show you the status of the log collector instance:

	![CONTAINER ID 2d7cadgfS4a1 13.14\* CPU 1.22\* MEM USAGE / LIMIT 187
	.1MiB / 1.39GiB NET I/o 10.gMB / 3 .23MB](vl5158cy.jpg)
1. Press **Ctrl-C** to end the command. 
1. Next, run the command below:

	```
	docker logs --details LogCollector
	```

	This command will show you the logs from the log collector to verify if
	it encountered errors when initiating:

	Â 

#### To go further in the troubleshooting, you can connect to the log collector container to investigates the different logs.

1. Type the following command:

	```
	docker exec -it LogCollector bash
	```

1. You can then explore the container filesystem and inspect the
	**/var/adallom** directory. This directory is where you will investigate
	issues with the syslog or ftp logs being sent to the collector

	![ovjlyn26.jpg](media/ovjlyn26.jpg)

-   **/adallom/ftp/discovery**: this folder contains the data source
    folders where you send the log files for automated upload. This is
    also the default folder when logging into the collector with FTP
    credentials.

-   **/adallom/syslog/discovery**: if you setup the log collector to
    receive syslog messages, this is where the flat file of aggregated
    messages will reside until it is uploaded.

-   **/adallom/discoverylogsbackup**: this folder contains the last file
    that was sent to MCAS. This is useful for looking at the raw log in
    case there are parsing issues.

1. To validate that logs are correctly received from the network appliance,
you can also verify the **/var/log/pure-ftpd** directory and check the
transfer log:

	![erx39v7i.jpg](media/erx39v7i.jpg)

1. Now, move to the **/var/log/adallom** directory.

	![0h029uih.jpg](media/0h029uih.jpg)

-   **/var/log/adallom/columbus**: this folder is where you will find
    log files useful for troubleshooting issues with the collector
    sending files. In the log-archive folder you can copy previous logs
    compressed as .tar.gz files off the collector to send to support.

-   **/var/log/adallom/columbusInstaller**: this is where you will
    investigate issues with the collector itself. You will find here
    logs related to the configuration and bootstrapping of the
    collector. For example, trace.log will show you the bootstrapping
    process:

### Verify the connectivity between the log collector and MCAS

An easy way to test this is to download a sample of your appliance logs
from MCAS and use WinSCP to connect to the log collector to upload that
log and see if it gets uploaded to MCAS.

Â 

1. Upload the logs in the folder named by your source:

![bqhxmpns.jpg](media/bqhxmpns.jpg)

Â 

1. Then, check in MCAS the status:

	![21pseval.jpg](media/21pseval.jpg)

Â 

	![mt0o095m.jpg](media/mt0o095m.jpg)

Â 

	> NOTE: If the log stays in the source folder, then you know you probably have a
connection issue between the log collector and MCAS.

Another way to validate the connection is to log into the container like
in the previous task and then run *netstat -a* to check if we see
connections to MCAS:

1. In the PuTTY window, type the command below:

	```
	netstat -a
	```
